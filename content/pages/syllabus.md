Requirements
------------

The success of this course depends upon active student participation. A portion of the grade will therefore be based on participation and listening, preparation, collaboration, in-class assignments, and overall contribution to class discussions. Naturally, in order to participate, students must come to class on time and ready to discuss the readings and other materials.

Students will be required to submit brief reflections papers to the teaching staff via email by 5 PM the day before each class meeting for 8 of the 11 class sessions that include readings.

In addition to reading reflections, there are two major writing assignments. These assignments will be between 8 and 10 pages (no longer than 10 pages each), and will be based on materials from the syllabus, as well as students' own independent archival research in the many sources available at the Institute (such as the MIT Museum, the MIT Archives, the Tech Archives, and various library sources). Specific guidelines will be provided for each writing assignment with ample time to complete them. This course has no final exam.

Grades will be determined based on the following percentages:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| First writing assignment | 35% |
| Final writing assignment | 35% |
| Reflection papers | 20% |
| Class participation | 10%
